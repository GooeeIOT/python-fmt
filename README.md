# pyfmt

Python auto-formatting using [isort](https://isort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

### Using pip

```console
pip3 install git+https://github.com/GooeeIOT/pyfmt.git
```

### From source

```console
git clone https://github.com/GooeeIOT/pyfmt
cd pyfmt

# Run as a script

```console
python3 -m pyfmt
```

# Install the pyfmt utility in PATH
python setup.py install

# Like `install` + Allows code changes to propagate to the installed package
python setup.py develop
```

## Contrib

### Example Use in a Git Hook

Prevent a `git push` from completing if `pyfmt --check` returns that there are files that need to still be auto formatted. 

```console
ln -sf contrib/git_hooks/pre-push .git/hooks
```

> This is a check only and does not alter your code. Run `pyfmt` manually to autoformat the code.

### Example Use in a Jenkinsfile

You can add [contrib/jenkins/pyfmt.groovy](contrib/jenkins/pyfmt.groovy) to your Jenkins pipeline
library so that you can use `pyfmt` as a function in your `Jenkinsfile`s. For example, `pyfmt "src/ tests/"`. Read more about how to set that up at https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/ in the "Using Libraries" section.

## Usage

*Just FYI*, `isort` works best when your virtual environment is active (if your src relies on one).
This will then allow imports to sort in the correct way (system packages, 3rd party packages, local/project packages).
If you are not in your virtual env, the global Python environment will be used which might place
your local package imports in with the 3rd party package imports.

```console
usage: pyfmt [-h] [--check] [--line-length LINE_LENGTH]
             [--extra-isort-args EXTRA_ISORT_ARGS]
             [--extra-black-args EXTRA_BLACK_ARGS]
             [PATH]

positional arguments:
  PATH                  path to base directory where pyfmt will be run;
                        defaults to $BASE_CODE_DIR or the current directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --check               don't write changes, just print the files that would
                        be formatted
  --line-length LINE_LENGTH
                        max characters per line; defaults to $MAX_LINE_LENGTH
                        or 100
  --extra-isort-args EXTRA_ISORT_ARGS
                        additional args to pass to isort
  --extra-black-args EXTRA_BLACK_ARGS
                        additional args to pass to black
```

* `--check` returns non-zero exist status if files need formatting, but doesn't modify files. This
  is appropriate for CI systems where you might want to fail a build if the code is not formatted
  correctly.
* If no specific path is specified, all files in the current directory and all sub directories where
  you run the code will be formatted.
* As a matter of convenience, you may set `$BASE_CODE_DIR` in your environment and run the script
  in the case this is better for your needs.
